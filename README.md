# **Jenkins Setup and Pipeline Guide**

## **Introduction to Jenkins**
Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery)**. 
It allows developers to automate the building, testing, and deployment of applications.

---

## **Installing Jenkins on macOS**  
Follow these steps to install Jenkins on macOS:

### **Step 1: Install Homebrew (if not installed)**
Open the terminal and run:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### **Step 2: Install Jenkins using Homebrew**
```bash
brew install jenkins-lts
```

### **Step 3: Start Jenkins**
```bash
brew services start jenkins-lts
```

### **Step 4: Access Jenkins**
Jenkins runs on port **8080** by default. Open a browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```
Jenkins will ask for an **admin password**, which you can find by running:
```bash
cat /Users/$(whoami)/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```
Copy this password and paste it into the Jenkins setup page.

### **Step 5: Install Plugins**
During setup, install suggested plugins or manually install plugins like:
- **Docker Pipeline** (for running Docker-based builds)
- **Git Plugin** (to fetch repositories from GitHub)
- **Pipeline Plugin** (for writing Jenkins pipelines)

---

## **Configuring Jenkins for Docker**
If you want Jenkins to run inside Docker or execute Docker commands, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Install Docker**
Download and install **Docker Desktop** from [Dockerâ€™s official site](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### **Step 2: Add Jenkins to the Docker Group**
Run the following command to allow Jenkins to use Docker:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
newgrp docker
```
Then restart Jenkins:
```bash
brew services restart jenkins-lts
```

### **Step 3: Verify Docker is Running**
Run:
```bash
docker --version
```
It should output the installed Docker version.

## **How Jenkins Works**
Jenkins follows a **Pipeline-based** automation approach where you define the steps of your CI/CD workflow in a **Jenkinsfile**. 
This file is stored in your repository and executed when triggered by **Git pushes, scheduled jobs, or manual runs**.

### **Key Components of Jenkins**
- **Agent**: The environment where Jenkins executes builds.
- **Stages**: Logical steps in the pipeline (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy).
- **Steps**: Individual commands executed in each stage.

---

## **Understanding Your Jenkinsfile**
Hereâ€™s the Jenkinsfile you provided:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent {
    docker { image 'node:16-alpine' }
  }
  stages {
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        sh 'node --version'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Breakdown of the Code**
1. **Defining the Pipeline**
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
   ```
   - This defines a **Jenkins Pipeline**, which automates CI/CD tasks.

2. **Setting the Agent**
   ```groovy
   agent {
     docker { image 'node:16-alpine' }
   }
   ```
   - This tells Jenkins to run the pipeline inside a **Docker container** with the `node:16-alpine` image.
   - The container provides a clean, isolated environment to execute the build.

3. **Defining Stages**
   ```groovy
   stages {
   ```
   - Stages define different steps in the pipeline.

4. **Test Stage**
   ```groovy
   stage('Test') {
   ```
   - This stage is named **Test**.

5. **Executing a Shell Command**
   ```groovy
   steps {
     sh 'node --version'
   }
   ```
   - The `sh` step runs the shell command `node --version`, which prints the Node.js version inside the container.

---

## **Running Your Jenkinsfile**
To execute your pipeline:
1. **Create a GitHub repository** and add your `Jenkinsfile` to the root directory.
2. In Jenkins, create a **new Pipeline job**.
3. Choose **"Pipeline script from SCM"** and enter your GitHub repo URL.
4. Save and click **"Build Now"**.
